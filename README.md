Investigate Business Hotel using Data Visualization

## Problems
It is crucial for a company to consistently analyze its business performance. In this instance, we will delve deeper into the hospitality sector. Our focus is to understand the customer behavior regarding hotel bookings and its correlation with the cancellation rate. The insights we gather will be presented through data visualization for better comprehension and a more persuasive impact.

## Data Pre-Processing
- Handle Missing Values
missing values in the ('children', 'city', 'agent', 'company') columns are adjusted
- Handle Data Types And Inappropriate Values
adjust the data types and adjust the value in the ('meal') column
- Remove Unneccessary Data
Combining the (‘adults’,‘children’, ‘babies’) columns into a ‘total_guest’ column. and the ‘stay_in_weekday_night’ and ‘stay_in_weekend_night’ columns become ‘stay_duration’. Removes rows that have stay_duration and total_guest = 0 values

From the above visualization, I analyzed the average number of hotel bookings each month based on the type of hotel: Resort Hotel and City Hotel. Each hotel type is represented by a different color in the visualization.

An interesting observation is that the busiest months are from June to July. These two months often coincide with the extended school holiday period in Indonesia. As schools are on break, parents frequently take their children on vacation.

With the extended holiday period, hotel bookings are expected to increase. Therefore, during these busy months, it is important to implement measures/preventive actions to prevent a decline in hotel ratings.

The data indicates two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. These two hotel types have different characteristics regarding bookings and cancellation rates based on the booking lead time.

The data is then divided based on the duration of booking time, with several categories: < 1 Month, 2-4 Months, 5-7 Months, 8-10 Months, 11-12 Months, and >12 Months. From the above visualization, the booking duration plays a crucial role in the cancellation rate, with some durations having lower cancellation rates than others.

One interesting finding is that the booking time tends to influence the cancellation rate. The highest cancellation rate occurs for bookings between 11-12 months, which is 77.41% for City Hotel and 43.5% for Resort Hotel. The lowest data is found for bookings less than 1 month, which is 22.47% for City Hotel and 13.11% for Resort Hotel.

From this interpretation, it is essential to plan better business marketing strategies and hotel management, especially concerning booking durations and reducing cancellations.
